    "###### Scikit‑learn linear regression was used to relate state‑level uninsured rate changes to Medicaid expansion status and coverage gains, then the fitted model’s average predicted 5‑year change was added to the observed 2015 national uninsured rate (9.4%) to obtain a projected 2020 rate under a “policy‑as‑is” scenario.\n",

This suggests that, if the 2010–2015 relationship between Medicaid expansion, coverage gains, and uninsured rate changes had continued unchanged for another five years, the U.S. could have approached very low uninsured levels by 2020, much closer to near‑universal coverage.\n"
